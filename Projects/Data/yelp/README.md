# Codecademy + Yelp

[Yelp](www.yelp.com) was founded in 2004 to help people find great local businesses.

We have partnered with Yelp Data Science team for the Linear Regression Cumulative Project and you will be working with real data from Yelp to predict the Yelp rating of a restaurant.

Thank you Yelp for this partnership and especially:

- Sebastian Couvidat, Sr. Data Scientist, Yelp
