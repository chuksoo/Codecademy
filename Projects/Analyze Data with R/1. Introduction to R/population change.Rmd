You work at the UN in urban planning and are interested in tracking population growth across major metropolitan regions. You are hoping that by looking at historical population numbers that you can predict future growth and help your team make decisions about resourcing.

Use what youâ€™ve learned about the basics of R to calculate the population growth of Istanbul and create a short report.

```{r error=TRUE}
calculate_annual_growth <- function(year_one,year_two,pop_y1, pop_y2,city) {
  annual_growth <- (((pop_y2 - pop_y1) / pop_y1) * 100) / (year_two-year_one)
  message <- paste("From", year_one, "to", year_two, "the population of", city, "grew by approximately", annual_growth, "% each year.")
  print(message)
  return(annual_growth)
}
# Write your code starting here:
year_one = 1927
year_two = 1950
city_name <- "Istanbul, Turkey"
pop_year_one <- 691000
pop_year_two <- 983000
pop_change <- pop_year_two - pop_year_one
print(pop_change)

# calculate the annual percentage growth rate
percentage_gr <- ((pop_year_two - pop_year_one) / pop_year_one) * 100
print(percentage_gr)

# calculate the annual percentage growth
annual_gr <- percentage_gr / (year_two - year_one)
print(annual_gr)

calculate_annual_growth(1927, 1950, 691000, 983000, city_name)
```
