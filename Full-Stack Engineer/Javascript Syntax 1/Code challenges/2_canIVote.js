// The most common minimum age to vote is 18. Write a function canIVote() that takes in a number, representing the personâ€™s age, and returns the boolean true if they are 18 years old or older, and the boolean false if they are not.
function canIVote(age) {
  if (age >= 18) {
    return true;
  } else {
    return false;
  }
}

// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
console.log(canIVote(19)); // Should print true

// We encourage you to add more function calls of your own to test your code!
