// Write a function, sillySentence(), that has 3 string parameters and returns the following silly sentence with the blanks filled in by the arguments passed into the function:
const sillySentence = (strOne, strTwo, strThree) => {
  return ("I am so " + `${strOne}` + " because I " + `${strTwo}` + " coding! Time to write some more awesome " + `${strThree}` + "!");
};

// Uncomment the line below when you're ready to try out your function
console.log(sillySentence("excited", "love", "functions"));

// We encourage you to add more function calls of your own to test your code!
